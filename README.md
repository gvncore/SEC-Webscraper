# SEC-Webscraper
A python programme that provides code for extracting different types of information out of SEC 10-K filings. The code enables to fetch data with pre-made functions (can be used as API) but can also be modified and extended. Currently, the functions can be used to extract financial statements (balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements) and one can fetch the data of different financial positions. This can either be useful for creating own datasets with specific variables or for the development and analysis of time series.
